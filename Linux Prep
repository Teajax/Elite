1: What is Linux and what are its main features?
Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on Unix. 
Its main features include its stability, security, flexibility, free of cost, 
and support for a wide range of hardware.

2: What is the difference between Linux and UNIX?
The primary difference is that Linux is open source and free, while UNIX is proprietary. 
Additionally, Linux is widely used for a variety of applications, 
whereas UNIX is primarily used in large enterprises.

3: What is the Linux Kernel?
The Linux kernel is the core(heart) of the Linux operating system. 
It acts as an interface between the computer's hardware and the software running on it.
It manages cpu and memory in devices like Running Multiple programs at once, Organizing Files & Storage, Managing n/w Communications

4: What is a shell in Linux?
A shell in Linux is an CLI that allows users to interact with the operating system by running commands.

5:find files in Linux?
  1. Find a file by name (syntax)
     find /path -name filename

     Example:
     find /home -name test.txt

     Case-insensitive:
     find /home -iname test.txt

  2. Find files by type
     Files only:
     find /path -type f

     Directories only:
     find /path -type d

  3. Find files by extension
     find /path -type f -name "*.log"
	
  4. Find files by size
     Files larger than 100MB:
     find /path -type f -size +100M

     Files smaller than 1KB:
     find /path -type f -size -1k

  5. Find files by time
     Modified more than 7 days ago:
     find /path -type f -mtime +7
     
     Modified in last 1 day:
     find /path -type f -mtime -1

  6. Find and delete files (be careful ⚠️)
     find /path -type f -mtime +30 -delete

  7. Find text inside files
     grep "ERROR" /path/*.log

     Recursive:
     grep -R "ERROR" /path

6]change file & directory permissions
  Numeric (octal) method  (most common)
  chmod 755 file.sh
  Owner → 7 (rwx)
  Group → 5 (r-x)
  Others → 5 (r-x)

  chmod 777 file - Everyone full access (unsafe)
  chmod 644 file - Owner write, others read
  chmod 600 file - Owner only

  Symbolic method
  chmod u+x script.sh
  u → user (owner)
  g → group
  o → others
  a → all

  chmod g+w file - add group write permission
  chmod o-r file - remove others read permission
  chmod a+x script.sh - add all execute permission

7]check current path/directory
  pwd 

8]use of pipe in Linux
  A pipe passes the result of one command as input to the next command.
  grep "ERROR" /var/log/*.log | tail -n 50
  
9]How can you check for free disk space
  df -h
  Sample Output
  Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
  /dev/sda1        50G   30G   18G  63% /
  tmpfs           2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm

  Size → Total disk size
  Used → Space already used
  Avail → Free disk space
  Use% → Percentage used
  Mounted on → Directory where disk is attached

10]To view content of a file and different methods
   The cat command in Linux is used to display the contents of a file, combine files, or create new files.
   1.View a file
     cat file.txt

   2.View multiple files together
     cat file1.txt file2.txt

   3.Create a new file
     cat > newfile.txt
     Type some text
     Press Ctrl + D to save and exit

   4.Append to an existing file
     cat >> existingfile.txt
     Adds text at the end of the file
     Press Ctrl + D to finish
   
   5.Combine files into a new file
     cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt
     > overwrites the file if it exists
     >> appends instead of overwriting

   6.Number lines (useful for logs)
     cat -n file.txt
     Sample output:
	1  Hello World
	2  This is a sample file
	3  Linux commands are fun

   7.| Command | Shows             | Notes                        
     | ------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
     | `less`  | File page by page | Can scroll up & down, search |
     | `more`  | File page by page | Forward only                 |
     | `head`  | First N lines     | Default 10                   |
     | `tail`  | Last N lines      | `-f` for real-time           |
     | `nl`    | Numbered lines    | Adds line numbers            |
    
11]ls & lscpu  cmd
   ls lists files and directories, and with options can show details, hidden files, sizes, and sorting.
	ls -l        # long listing
	ls -a        # include hidden files
	ls -lh       # human-readable sizes
	ls -la       # long + hidden
	ls -lt       # sort by modification time
	ls -d */     # only directories
	ls -R        # recursive

   The lscpu command in Linux is used to display detailed information about the CPU architecture of the system
